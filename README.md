 You can create the anaconda environment needed for running the engine from the environment.yml file using the following command in your terminal:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To execute the engine use the following command 
```bash
python3 main.py -c config.yml
```

## 1. Motivation
Generative AI is soooooo hot right now! That is why I desiced to build a generative 3D design engine purely based on basic mathematics (BOOOORING!!!), 100% explainable using 34 parameter :). This is actually true, check out the `config.yml` file in the repo.

The motivation for this projects goes back to my time as a Tech Lead being part of a great team pioniering 3D-printing of glass. We needed to generated different 3D-objects to explore and probe the high-dimensional parameter space of our manifacturing process. To overcome the timedemanding and manual 3D-design process I developed an infancy design tool which was purly based on cylinder symetric 3D-designs. Years later and as a side project I have to descided to restart this project and generalized the design capabilities by introducting rotational symetric design elements. The image below shows nine randomly generated 3D designs.

*Claude Elwood Shannon*, the father of information theory concluded that **information is surprise**. Only when we are surprised, we will learn something profound and important about the underlying dynamics and laws of nature! This is also applicable in the context of arts & design since these disciplines meet at the intersection of control and accident leading to surprise.

**So fasten your seatbelts ladies and gents, because you will see some freaky linear algebra combined with nasty functions all wrapped up in pure Python ðŸ¤“**

## 2. The math behind the Leonardo Engine

This chapter will illuminate some light on the thoughts and concepts behind the engine. I am not claiming that this approach is the most elegant one, but it does the job. Suggestions for improvements are warmly welcome!

### 2.0. Coordinate systems
The engine is based on three different coordinate systems: cylindrical, spherical, and torus coordinates. The subchapters below are quickly reviewing the basics of these coordinate systems.

#### 2.0.1. Cylindrical Coordinates

Cylindrical coordinates can be related to Cartesian coordinates using the following equations:

```math
x = r \cdot \cos(\varphi) \\
y = r \cdot \sin(\varphi) \\
z = z \\
```


Where \( r \) is the distance from the origin in the xy-plane, \( \varphi \) is the angle from the positive x-axis, and \( z \) is the height above the xy-plane.

#### 2.0.2. Spherical Coordinates

Spherical coordinates can be related to Cartesian coordinates using the following equations:

```math
x = r \cdot \cos(\varphi) \cdot \sin(\theta) \\
y = r \cdot \sin(\varphi) \cdot \sin(\theta) \\
z = r \cdot \cos(\theta)
```

Where \( r \) is the distance from the origin, \( \varphi \) is the angle in the xy-plane, and \( \theta \) is the angle from the positive z-axis.

#### 2.0.3. Torus Coordinates

Torus coordinates are a bit more complex to relate to Cartesian coordinates due to the torus' curved geometry. They are given by:

- \( x = (R + r \cdot \cos(\theta)) \cdot \cos(\varphi) \)
- \( y = (R + r \cdot \cos(\theta)) \cdot \sin(\varphi) \)
- \( z = r \cdot \sin(\theta) \)

Where \( R \) is the major radius, \( r \) is the minor radius, \( \theta \) is the azimuthal angle, and \( \phi \) is the angle in the xy-plane.

These equations allow us to translate points between the cylindrical, spherical, and torus coordinate systems and the familiar Cartesian coordinate system.


### 2.1. Grid generation

To generate a grid of points, we need to define the number of points in each dimension. Thus we will choose a 2D-grid consisting of two angles $(\varphi, \theta) \in [0, 2\pi[ \times [0, \pi]$. The grid is generated by the `generate_grid()` function in the `engine.py` module.
The grid is generated by the following code snippet:

```python
a, b = np.meshgrid(a, b)  # Generate meshgrid from linespaces
a, b = a.flatten(), b.flatten()  # Flatten to array
triangles = mtri.Triangulation(a, b)  # Create triangles
```

The `a` and `b` variables are the linespaces for the angles $\varphi$ and $\theta$ respectively. 
Once the grid is passed into the formulas for the described coordinate systems, $(x, y, z)$ coordiantes can be calculated for each point in the grid along with the corresponding triangulation. It's important to notice, that

The `triangles` variable is a `matplotlib.tri.Triangulation` object which is used to generate the 3D mesh. It's possible to pass the `triangles` object alongside the corresponding $(x,y,z)$ coordinates e.g. to the `plot_trisurf()` function of the `matplotlib` module to generate the 3D mesh or in this case to pass the `triangles` object to the `plotly` `graph_objs.Mesh3d` object to generate the 3D mesh. Using `plotly` for 3D visualization is a bit more convenient since it allows to interact with the 3D mesh and to rotate it in the browser. It also requires extraction of the vertix indicesfrom the `triangles` object. This is done by `get_ijk()` function in the `engine.py` module.


### 2.2. Twist, Tilt & Shout
Twisting and tilting are essential transformations for generating interesting 3D designs. The following subchapters will explain the math behind these transformations.

#### 2.2.1 Rotation about the x-axis

To rotate a point \( P(x, y, z) \) counterclockwise by an angle \( \theta \) about the x-axis, the rotation matrix is:

\[
R_x(\theta) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\
    0 & \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The new coordinates \( P'(x', y', z') \) can be found by multiplying the rotation matrix by the original coordinates:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
    x' \\
    y' \\
    z'
\end{bmatrix}=
R_x(\theta)
\begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    z
\end{bmatrix}
\]

#### 2.2.2. Rotation about the y-axis

To rotate a point \( P(x, y, z) \) counterclockwise by an angle \( \theta \) about the y-axis, the rotation matrix is:

\[
R_y(\theta) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \cos(\theta) & 0 & \sin(\theta) \\
    0 & 1 & 0 \\
    -\sin(\theta) & 0 & \cos(\theta)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The new coordinates \( P'(x', y', z') \) can be found by multiplying the rotation matrix by the original coordinates:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
    x' \\
    y' \\
    z'
\end{bmatrix}=
R_y(\theta)
\begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    z
\end{bmatrix}
\]

#### 2.2.3. Rotation about the z-axis

To rotate a point \( P(x, y, z) \) counterclockwise by an angle \( \theta \) about the z-axis, the rotation matrix is:

\[
R_z(\theta) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) & 0 \\
    \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The new coordinates \( P'(x', y', z') \) can be found by multiplying the rotation matrix by the original coordinates:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
    x' \\
    y' \\
    z'
\end{bmatrix}=
R_z(\theta)
\begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    z
\end{bmatrix}
\]
